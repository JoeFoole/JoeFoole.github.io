           <h2>Maxim Principles & Values</h2>

           <p>Over the years, a cornerstone to Maxim's success has been our company culture. Much of that culture is reflected in the Maxim Principles, eight guidelines initially articulated by Maxim founder Jack Gifford in the early days of the Company and updated in 2011. The product of over 40 years of work/life experience, the Maxim Principles represent practical wisdom gained through successes and failures alike—the latter often proving the most valuable. <br></br>
The Maxim Principles have proven an effective guide throughout the history of the Company. They continue to benefit employees, shareholders, and customers as a solid foundation for high quality, innovation, efficiency, and competitiveness. </p>

            <p>Babble doesn't work here.</p>
            <p>I know that I am right and you are f____ing wrong.</p>
            <p>Be advised: your boss may think you know what you are talking about, but you don't.</p>
            <p>The goal is singular-to do better than our competitors. You only have to be better than the guy next to you. (grizzly bear story followed).</p>
            <p>Yeah, telling them is asking them.</p>
            <p>I was going to ask questions about it, but if there is no one here with any knowledge, then there is no point.</p>
            <p>What do you people think about when you drive to work in the morning?! Numbers like these should bother you!</p>
            <p>Any disk drive customer is the scourge of the earth.</p>
            <p>What do you want me to do, yell at them? I tried that. It doesn't work.</p>
            <p>I don't have time to explain basic arithmetic to you.</p>
            <p>What do I have to do, write you a note?</p>
            <p>That's the f____ing wind. I don't even listen to that. -JFG hearing a forecast "booking ahead" excuse (July, 1995)</p>
            <p>When people say something silly, you're going to get hammered, so think about what you're going to say before you say it.</p>
            <p>I can count the number of wafers on my fingers and toes, because there is nothing running!</p>
            <p>If this were easy, then every bean dog in the country would be doing this. That's what we get paid for!</p>
            <p>Persistence is more important than intelligence.</p>
            <p>We tend to be myopic. We got to look around more.</p>
            <p>We are not experts yet, but that doesn't stop us from trying.</p>
            <p>I believe that success does not come with 8 hour days or lack of anxiety.</p>
            <p>I could tell you how to hit a baseball until I am blue in the face, but unless you go out and do it, you'll never learn how.</p>
            <p>Sounds pretty flimsy to me. What's the next excuse?</p>
            <p>You can't make competency out of incompetency.</p>
